# Poecilia_parae_Y_Diversity
 This directory contains the pipelines and associated scripts used in the manuscript *Extreme Y chromosome polymorphism corresponds to five male reproductive morphs* by: Benjamin A Sandkam, Pedro Almeida, Iulia Darolti, Benjamin Furman, Wouter van der Bijl, Jake Morris, Godfrey Bourne, Felix Breden, Judith E. Mank.

The overall pipeline follows the order indicated on the filename:
  1_Read_prep_and_De_novo_assembly.md
  2_RACA_female_assembly.md
  3_RACA_coverage.md
  4_Ymer_identification.md
  5_Ymer_phylogeny.md
  6_Ymer_validation.md
  7a_Male_Scaffold_Identification.md
  7b_Male_Scaffold_annotation.md
  8_Male_Scaffold_coverage.md
  9_Autosomal_Phylogenies.md

Script and pipelines have been annotated throughout and filenames must be adjusted as indicated. See manuscript for full details.

*Note: Many of the steps require heavy computational power. We ran most of these pipelines on a system with 48 cores, 1.5Tb RAM, and 50Tb storage. A few pipelines were run on a desktop with 36 cores, 128Gb RAM, and 4Tb storage.*
